# PyParticleProcessor
Cave: This module is in a rough pre-alpha stage! Comments and Collaborators very welcome, though!

## Introduction
The PyParticleProcessor is a QT5/python3 based tool with a GUI to import and export ion beam information (particle data) from various different simulation packages. There is some limited functionality for plotting these particle data and calculate emittances and Twiss parameters. Users can add their own "drivers" both for analysis tools and import/export.

## Current Supported Programs
Cave: These are all limited support and need to be expanded. Many of those software packages give the user freedom on how to export data themselves, so care has to be taken to export in the same manor.
